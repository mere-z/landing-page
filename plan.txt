What kind of website? .......we can probably just do a kinda boring
placeholder website identical (as much as possible) to the given design.

I have no surging ideas eager to be put onto page atm.

Head empty. Flexbox ready? hopefully. 

Actually, I have an idea! 

We could make a scuffed google as boring as that is, it's...less boring
than outright copying.

New plan: deceptive google sounds more......purposeful :) and now we can 
do "funny" things with the links

Nvm we decided to just copy as its much easier to compare with the "proper" design this way. Innovation comes later ^_^
