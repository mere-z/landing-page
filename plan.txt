What kind of website? .......we can probably just do a kinda boring
placeholder website identical (as much as possible) to the given design.

I have no surging ideas eager to be put onto page atm.

Head empty. Flexbox ready? hopefully. 

Actually, I have an idea! 

We could make a scuffed google as boring as that is, it's...less boring
than outright copying.
