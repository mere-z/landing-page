This is an attempt to replicate a provided website design using HTML and css.

The website should be able to be found here, However. Right now it says 404. So. It may not be able to found there. It is yet to be determined whether it will be able to be found there or not ._.

Nevermind, the website can indeed be found here:
https://mere-z.github.io/landing-page/ 

This website is kind of incredibly boring at the moment however it was good for flexbox practice x.x
